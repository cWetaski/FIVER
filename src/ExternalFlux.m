classdef ExternalFlux < Flux
    %EXTERNALFLUX Defines an external flux which is applied to a voxel space
    %   The flux is defined positionally in 2 dimensions x and y (z-component of position from ray_gen function is ignored) 
    %   with direction vectors always having z-component >0, and then the flux is rotated according to the specified 
    %   boundary.
    %
    
    properties
        boundary; % (scalar String) ["left","right", "bottom","top","back","front"]: the boundary which the flux is applied to.
